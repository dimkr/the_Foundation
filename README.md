# Lite: "C+"

Simplicity of C11, power of OO!

Keeping everything simple is priority #1.

Minor extension of C11 with an object-oriented mechanism:
- opaque objects (pimpl)
- class objects

Desireable (how to do?):
- constructors and destructors based on scope
- C++-like syntax for calling member functions where this pointer is passed automatically (obj->method(args) => method(obj, args))?
-
